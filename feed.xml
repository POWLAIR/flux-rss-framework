<p>If you’re looking to buy verified PayPal accounts, you’re not alone. Many online sellers and businesses seek verified PayPal accounts for seamless transactions.</p>

<p>A verified PayPal account is an essential tool for anyone who wants to access higher transaction limits and enjoy better protection against fraud.</p>

<p>When you buy verified PayPal accounts, you’re investing in a safer, more reliable way to manage online payments.</p>

<p>With verification, PayPal can confirm your identity, making your transactions smoother and more secure. You’ll experience fewer issues with limitations and suspensions compared to unverified accounts.</p>

<p>Can You Buy Verified PayPal Accounts?<br>
Yes, it is possible to buy verified PayPal accounts from reliable sources.</p>

<p>When you choose to buy verified PayPal accounts, you are essentially acquiring an account that has passed PayPal’s Know Your Customer (KYC) process.</p>

<p>This means the account has been validated and can carry out larger transactions with fewer restrictions.</p>

<p>However, it’s essential to ensure that you’re buying from a trusted seller to avoid falling for scams.</p>

<p>Buying verified PayPal accounts from untrustworthy sources can expose you to risks, so always choose reputable platforms.</p>

<p>Where Can You Buy Verified PayPal Accounts?<br>
When looking to buy verified PayPal accounts, you should always turn to legitimate and trustworthy sellers.</p>

<p>Online platforms like getusa.com specialize in offering high-quality, verified PayPal accounts.</p>

<p>Other reputable sites may also sell verified accounts, but ensure that the seller provides clear terms, customer support, and guarantees that the accounts are fully verified.</p>

<p>Avoid sketchy websites, as they may sell accounts that are flagged by PayPal, leading to possible account suspension.</p>

<p>Why You Should Choose getusa.com to Buy Verified PayPal Accounts<br>
If you’re considering buying verified PayPal accounts, getusa.com is one of the most reliable platforms to trust.</p>

<p>Their accounts are fully verified, and they offer a secure, fast, and straightforward process to purchase.</p>

<p>By choosing getusa.com to buy verified PayPal accounts, you ensure that your transactions will not only be secure but also comply with PayPal’s guidelines, minimizing the risk of account suspension.</p>

<p>Their customer service is top-notch, making it easy to resolve any issues after purchase.</p>

<p>Benefits of Buying Verified PayPal Accounts at getusa.com<br>

<p>Understanding Verified PayPal Accounts: What Does “Verified” Mean?<br>
A “verified” PayPal account refers to one that has undergone PayPal’s identity verification process, often requiring the user to link a bank account or credit card.</p>

<p>When you buy verified PayPal accounts, you’re essentially purchasing accounts that are already validated, meaning you won’t face the common restrictions or limitations associated with unverified accounts.</p>

<p>This verification gives PayPal greater confidence that you’re a legitimate user, which enhances your ability to send and receive payments without interruptions. It’s a critical step for any business or individual engaging in frequent online transactions.</p>

<p>Why People Choose to Buy Verified PayPal Accounts<br>
There are several reasons why individuals and businesses choose to buy verified PayPal accounts.</p>

<p>Verified accounts offer higher transaction limits, better fraud protection, and access to PayPal’s buyer and seller protection programs.</p>

<p>By choosing to buy verified PayPal accounts, users can quickly expand their business operations and enhance their credibility online.</p>

<p>Moreover, buying a verified PayPal account allows businesses to process large transactions without worrying about account restrictions.</p>

<p>These benefits make purchasing a verified account an appealing choice for many.</p>

<p>The Risks Involved in Buying Verified PayPal Accounts<br>
While buying verified PayPal accounts offers numerous advantages, there are certain risks involved.</p>

<p>If you don’t buy verified PayPal accounts from reputable sources, you could end up with an account that is flagged or blacklisted by PayPal.</p>

<p>This can result in immediate account suspension or the loss of funds. To mitigate risks, always purchase from trusted platforms that provide a money-back guarantee.</p>

<p>Make sure to do thorough research on the seller before finalizing your purchase to ensure that the account is legitimate.</p>

<p>How to Identify a Legitimate Seller of Verified PayPal Accounts<br>
When you decide to buy verified PayPal accounts, it’s crucial to identify a trustworthy seller.</p>

<p>A legitimate seller should offer clear information about their accounts, provide customer support, and be transparent about their verification process.</p>

<p>Look for positive reviews and testimonials from previous buyers. Reputable websites will often offer guarantees and terms of service to protect your purchase.</p>

<p>Avoid sellers who promise too-good-to-be-true deals or those who lack transparency. A legitimate platform should make it clear how they verify their accounts and ensure they comply with PayPal’s rules.</p>

<p>The Process of Verifying a PayPal Account: What’s Involved?<br>
To verify a PayPal account, users typically need to link their account with a bank account or credit card, and sometimes provide identification documents like a government-issued ID or proof of address.</p>

<p>This verification process helps PayPal confirm that the person behind the account is legitimate and authorized to make transactions.</p>

<p>When you choose to buy verified PayPal accounts, this verification step has already been completed for you, allowing you to immediately enjoy the benefits of an unrestrictive account.</p>

<p>Verification also ensures the account meets PayPal’s security requirements, safeguarding your transactions.</p>

<p>Is Buying a Verified PayPal Account Legal?<br>
Buying a verified PayPal account is not inherently illegal, but it’s crucial to ensure that the seller complies with PayPal’s terms of service.</p>

<p>PayPal’s official policies don’t explicitly forbid purchasing verified accounts; however, PayPal can suspend or limit accounts if they believe fraudulent activities are taking place.</p>

<p>It’s important to buy verified PayPal accounts only from reputable sellers who follow the correct procedures for obtaining the account.</p>

<p>By choosing a legitimate platform, you can avoid any legal issues associated with your account.</p>

<p>How Buying Verified PayPal Accounts Can Help E-commerce Businesses<br>
For e-commerce businesses, buying verified PayPal accounts can be a game-changer.</p>

<p>Verified accounts allow you to process payments without restrictions, enabling smooth transactions for customers.</p>

<p>Additionally, you’ll have access to increased transaction limits, which is especially important when scaling your online business.</p>

<p>By choosing to buy verified PayPal accounts, you can also enjoy PayPal’s buyer and seller protection, which can reduce the risk of chargebacks and fraud.</p>

<p>This helps businesses maintain a professional reputation while ensuring a secure payment process.</p>

<p>Advantages of Using a Verified PayPal Account for Online Transactions<br>
A verified PayPal account offers numerous advantages, especially when conducting online transactions.</p>

<p>Verified accounts enable higher transaction limits and more security features, which are crucial for businesses or individuals processing significant payments.</p>

<p>When you buy verified PayPal accounts, you’ll also benefit from faster withdrawals and the ability to receive payments from all around the world.</p>

<p>Furthermore, PayPal’s buyer and seller protection programs offer peace of mind in case of disputes. A verified account ensures a smooth, hassle-free experience with minimal restrictions.</p>

<p>Common Scams to Watch Out for When Purchasing Verified PayPal Accounts<br>
While the option to buy verified PayPal accounts can be convenient, there are scams to be aware of.</p>

<p>Fraudulent sellers often offer accounts at incredibly low prices, or they may claim to sell verified accounts that turn out to be fake or compromised. To avoid scams, never purchase from unverified websites or individuals.</p>

<p>Look for reviews, a professional website, and transparency in terms of account verification. It’s crucial to only buy verified PayPal accounts from established, trustworthy platforms to avoid losing your money or getting scammed.</p>

<p>How to Safely Buy Verified PayPal Accounts Without Falling for Fraud<br>
To safely buy verified PayPal accounts, always research the seller thoroughly before making a purchase.</p>

<p>Ensure the platform you’re purchasing from offers clear information about their account verification process and provides solid customer support.</p>

<p>A trustworthy seller should offer guarantees, such as account replacement if the account is flagged. Also, check for customer reviews and ratings to see if others have had positive experiences.</p>

<p>Avoid sellers offering unusually low prices or unverified accounts, as these could be traps to steal your money or personal information.</p>

<p>The Role of KYC (Know Your Customer) in PayPal Account Verification<br>
KYC (Know Your Customer) is an essential part of PayPal’s account verification process.</p>

<p>PayPal requires users to provide proof of identity and address to ensure they are not involved in fraudulent activities.</p>

<p>When you buy verified PayPal accounts, this KYC process has already been completed, ensuring that the account is fully compliant with PayPal’s policies.</p>

<p>KYC helps PayPal prevent money laundering and other illegal activities, making the platform safer for legitimate users. A verified account also enhances your credibility when dealing with online transactions.</p>

<p>Can You Transfer a Verified PayPal Account to Another User?<br>
No, PayPal’s policy states that accounts are non-transferable. Once you buy verified PayPal accounts, the account is meant to be used by the person who originally purchased it.</p>

<p>Transferring ownership of a verified PayPal account is against PayPal’s terms of service and can lead to account suspension or other penalties.</p>

<p>To maintain the integrity of your account, it’s essential to keep it under your ownership and ensure it’s used in compliance with PayPal’s rules.</p>

<p>How Verified PayPal Accounts Differ from Unverified Accounts<br>
Verified PayPal accounts differ significantly from unverified accounts in terms of transaction limits and features.</p>

<p>When you buy verified PayPal accounts, you’ll enjoy higher transaction limits and more security, making it easier to send and receive</p>

<p>payments. A verified account also gives you access to PayPal’s full range of services, including buyer and seller protection, which offers more security for both transactions and refunds.</p>

<p>In contrast, unverified accounts typically have lower transaction limits, restricted access to certain features, and may be subject to more frequent account reviews or freezes.</p>

<p>By purchasing a verified PayPal account, you ensure a smoother, more reliable experience for both personal and business transactions.</p>

<p>Alternatives to Buying Verified PayPal Accounts for Secure Payments<br>
If you’re considering alternatives to buying verified PayPal accounts, there are other ways to ensure secure online payments.</p>

<p>One option is to complete the verification process yourself. Linking your PayPal account to a bank account or credit card and submitting the required documentation will allow you to unlock the benefits of a verified account without the need to purchase one.</p>

<p>Additionally, other payment processors like Stripe or Skrill offer similar services with their own verification processes, which can also be used for secure transactions.</p>

<p>However, if you’re in a hurry or don’t want to go through the verification process, buying a verified PayPal account can save time and effort.</p>

<p>What to Do if Your Verified PayPal Account Gets Suspended or Locked<br>
If your verified PayPal account gets suspended or locked, it can be a stressful experience, but it’s important to act quickly.</p>

<p>First, check your email for any notifications from PayPal explaining why the account was suspended.</p>

<p>PayPal usually locks accounts for reasons such as suspicious activity or a breach of their terms of service.</p>

<p>If you’ve bought a verified PayPal account, reach out to the seller or the platform where you made the purchase to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>You may need to provide additional information to PayPal to verify your identity or address the suspension.</p>

<p>Be sure to follow PayPal’s steps to resolve the issue and, if necessary, escalate the matter to their customer service team.</p>

<p>Whether you’re aiming for higher transaction limits, better security, or a more reliable payment method, verified PayPal accounts provide a strong foundation for safe and efficient online payments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[[DEV Community: javascript] Humanoid Robot Control: A Simple Guide for Everyone]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>
  
  
  Have you ever wondered how a robot that looks like a human can walk, grab things, or even stand up after falling?
</h1>

<p>It's not magic—it's something called <strong>Humanoid Robot Control</strong>. Think of it like the robot's brain and nervous system working together. Just like you think before you pick up a glass, a robot needs instructions to move its motors smoothly and stay balanced. In this article, we'll break down this cool technology into simple pieces that anyone can understand.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What Is Humanoid Robot Control?
</h2>

<p><strong>Simple Answer</strong>: <strong>Humanoid Robot Control</strong> is the system of hardware and software that tells a human-like robot how to move and keep its balance. It's like the robot's brain (computers and algorithms) sending signals to its muscles (motors and gears) to perform tasks like walking, climbing, or handling objects safely.</p>

<p>Controlling a robot that stands on two legs is super hard. Unlike a car with four stable wheels, a humanoid is always at risk of falling. That's why engineers study how humans move and then teach robots to do the same using sensors, cameras, and smart computer programs.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Three Main Parts of Robot Control
</h2>

<p>To understand <strong>Humanoid Robot Control</strong>, let's break it down into three simple layers:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Thinking (Planning)
</h3>

<p>The robot figures out what to do. For example, "I need to step over this box." It uses AI to map out movements without hitting anything. This is where cool tech like <strong>Videomimic</strong> comes in, where a robot watches a video of a human doing something and copies the action.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Moving (Control)
</h3>

<p>This is the part that sends exact commands to the motors. It decides how much power goes to each joint—like the knee or elbow—to make the movement smooth.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Feeling (Feedback)
</h3>

<p>Sensors in the robot's feet and joints constantly check if it's tilting too much. If it starts to fall, the control system instantly adjusts the motors to push it back upright. This is called <strong>reactive balancing</strong>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why Is It So Hard to Make a Robot Walk Like a Human?
</h2>

<p><strong>Quick Answer</strong>: Walking on two legs is tricky because a robot has to constantly balance itself in a changing environment. Unlike a robot with four legs, a humanoid has a small support area (just its two feet). It needs to handle bumps, push forces, and uneven ground without falling—all while moving its arms and body.</p>

<p>According to advanced research, modern robots use "<strong>multi-contact planning</strong>." This means they don't just think about their feet; they plan to use hands, knees, or elbows to touch walls or rails for support, just like a person climbing a ladder.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How Do Robots Learn to Move? (The Role of Video Mimic)
</h2>

<p>One of the most exciting developments in robotics is teaching machines by showing them videos. This process, often called <strong>video mimic</strong> or <strong>Videomimic</strong>, is changing the game. Instead of writing millions of lines of code, engineers at Labellerr AI and other research labs use AI to watch humans.</p>

<p>For example, if you want a robot to learn how to wave, you show it a video of a person waving. The AI breaks down the video frame by frame, figures out the angles of the human arm, and translates that into motor commands for the robot. This makes training robots much faster and more natural. It's exactly what happens with <strong>monocular video to humanoid control</strong>, where a single camera view is enough to teach complex actions.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What Goes Inside a Robot's "Brain"? Motor Control Explained
</h2>

<p>At the very core of movement are tiny computers and drivers that control the motors. Humanoid robots need special motor controllers. These controllers have to be incredibly fast—reacting in milliseconds—to keep the robot balanced. They manage everything from the big motors in the legs to tiny ones in the fingers. They also handle communication, making sure the "brain" in the head can talk to the "muscles" in the feet without delay.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Key Components Inside a Robot
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Position Sensors</strong>: Like a bike's speedometer, these tell the robot exactly where its joints are. Common types are optical or magnetic encoders.</li>
<li>
<strong>Power Stage</strong>: This manages the electricity flowing to the motors. Since robots run on batteries, efficiency is key to making them last longer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Real-Time Communication</strong>: Systems like EtherCAT or CAN-FD make sure commands get to the motors instantly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Real-World Challenges: Stance and Balance
</h2>

<p>Imagine you are standing on a moving bus. You bend your knees and hold a rail to stay steady. Robots do the same thing! Advanced control systems now use "<strong>stance planning</strong>." This means the robot doesn't just think about walking; it thinks about every single point of contact with the world. If it's pushing a heavy door, it might shift its weight to one foot and use a hand on the wall. This is called <strong>loco-manipulation</strong>—moving and handling stuff at the same time.</p>

<p>To build better robots, companies like Labellerr AI are focusing on making this process simpler using data. By using <strong>Videomimic</strong>, they reduce the need for complex math and let the AI figure out the best stance just by watching humans.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Main Benefits of Modern Robot Control Systems
</h2>

<p>✅ <strong>Better Balance</strong>: Robots can recover from pushes or slips.<br><br>
✅ <strong>Faster Learning</strong>: Using video mimic, robots learn new tasks in hours instead of months.<br><br>
✅ <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>: Smarter algorithms mean motors use less battery power.<br><br>
✅ <strong>Adaptability</strong>: They can walk on grass, sand, or even climb stairs with handrails.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How Does Labellerr AI Help in This Field?
</h2>

<p>Creating these smart robots requires tons of data. Robots need to see millions of examples of humans walking, jumping, or grabbing things. That's where <strong>Labellerr AI</strong> comes in. We specialize in preparing visual data so that AI models can understand it. If a researcher has a video of a person doing a dance, Labellerr AI helps label every joint and movement in that video. This labeled data is then used to train the robot's control system through techniques like <strong>Humanoid Robot Control</strong> and <strong>Videomimic</strong>. It's like giving the robot a high-quality textbook to learn from.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Can a humanoid robot control itself if it trips?</strong><br><br>
Yes! Modern robots have "<strong>reactive balancing</strong>" systems. If sensors detect a fall, the control system instantly adjusts the torque in the ankles and hips to try to step forward or brace the fall, much like a human does. This is a key part of <strong>Humanoid Robot Control</strong> research.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is 'video mimic' or 'Videomimic' in simple words?</strong><br><br>
It's a teaching method where a robot learns a task by watching a video of a human. For example, you show a video of someone opening a door, and the robot's AI analyzes the video to copy the arm and leg movements. It's a short form of <strong>video-mimic technology</strong> that makes training faster.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do all humanoid robots use the same control system?</strong><br><br>
No, they differ based on the task. Some use simple pre-programmed moves, while advanced ones use AI-based control. New systems are moving towards learning from demonstration, which is much more flexible than traditional coding.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>
  
  
  Future of Humanoid Robot Control
</h2>

<p>The future is incredibly exciting. We are moving towards robots that can enter a factory they've never seen before and start working, simply by watching human workers. This is possible because of advances in <strong>video mimic</strong> and reinforcement learning. Simulations allow robots to practice millions of walks in a virtual world before trying it in real life. This "training in a video game" approach allows them to fail safely and learn faster. Once they master the virtual world, their control systems are ready for the real one.</p>

<p>At Labellerr AI, we believe that the key to perfecting <strong>Humanoid Robot Control</strong> lies in high-quality data. By accurately labeling human actions in videos, we bridge the gap between human movement and robot execution. This is the core of the <strong>Videomimic</strong> process.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[[Release notes from parcel] v2.16.0]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This release significantly improves code splitting and tree shaking when scope hoisting is disabled, e.g. when using React Server Components with static rendering. It enables re-exports to be followed when resolving a dependency, so that only used exports from large libraries get bundled together for each page rather than across all pages. This was already the case when using scope hoisting, but now it works without scope hoisting as well.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>

<li>JavaScript

      </div>
    </p>
<p>As you see above, the guide is supposed to teach how to use <em>accessibility semantics defined by the Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA)</em>. And it looks <strong>very</strong> authoritative. When I first discovered it after some googling, I treated this guide as the source of truth because it lives under <code>w3<wbr>.org</code> and looks very official. I learned early on that using ARIA correctly is hard; and thought that APG must be the place showing me how to do ARIA correctly.</p>
<p>It sort of is but not really.</p>
<p>Lately, I've seen many accessibility folks raise concerns about APG, and Eric's article echoes some of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The APG was created to demonstrate ARIA's capabilities. Because of this, it disproportionately favors ARIA in its code examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The guide is there to <strong>showcase</strong> ARIA usage patterns and if people want to showcase something they might overuse it at times. This is true for ARIA usage in the APG, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The APG was also not created to serve as a pattern library, design system, or single source of truth for the &quot;right way&quot; to make something. Unfortunately, a lot of people treat it this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand Eric's point, but I also can't blame people for treating the guide as &quot;the right way&quot;. The home page literally says that &quot;APG provides design patterns and functional examples&quot;. It's hosted on <code>w3<wbr>.org</code>. It looks very official. If there's a line between &quot;a collection of design patterns&quot; and a &quot;pattern library&quot; at all, it's a very thin one.</p>
<p>Of course people treat the Authoring Practice Guide as the right way to do things — when I discovered it, I did, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recall here that the original reason for APG code is to be a showpiece for how ARIA could hypothetically be used. Because of this, it is not the APG's concern that ARIA does not have perfect support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is by far the biggest reason why I don't pretend to know when something is truly accessible. <strong>Nothing is ever fully accessible to everyone, and the world of assistive technology is huge.</strong> A single ARIA attribute might make things more accessible in theory, but who knows if it works across all browser-screen reader combinations.</p>
<p>The effort alone to verify that an ARIA pattern works well across assistive technologies is massive.</p>
<hr aria-hidden="true"><p>But what are the guide's valuable parts? Eric highlights the pattern names, &quot;about this pattern&quot; section and the keyboard interaction specification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pattern names. Having a standardized way to refer to a discrete piece of UI that is larger than any one company is highly beneficial.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The content contained in the &quot;About This Pattern&quot; section. This is what the discrete piece of UI does, and how it goes about doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The content contained in the &quot;Keyboard Interaction&quot; section. This is how people who use assistive technology will expect things to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's good to know!</p>
<hr aria-hidden="true"><p><strong>So if you've been treating APG as the definitive source of truth, think again.</strong> Its examples demonstrate <em>what ARIA can do</em>, not necessarily <em>what you should do</em>.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you've discovered the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide or not, before reaching for a complex ARIA pattern found on the internet, the usual rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always start with native HTML: the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#firstrule" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FTR%2Fusing-aria%2F%23firstrule')">first rule of ARIA</a> is to use a native HTML element before adding ARIA. A <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> beats a <code>&lt;div role=&quot;button&quot;&gt;</code> every time regardless of what's written in a fancy ARIA guide or what your LLM claims to be accessible.</li>
<li>Test with assistive technology yourself: nothing beats firing up a screen reader and actually navigating your own UI. It's hard and time-consuming but you can't claim that something is accessible if you haven't tested it.</li>
<li>Follow practitioners who do the testing: as you might know, I'm a huge fan of <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fadrianroselli.com%2F')">Adrian Roselli</a> who constantly puts in the work of testing ARIA patterns with different assistive technology combination. He publishes findings on what actually works versus what the spec promises. Huge!</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't had the time to dive in yet, but this looks like a decent list, and I might go deeper next week. I do miss <code>sizes=auto</code> for images, though.</p>
<p>But I'm not complaining, so let's get to the web dev goodies of this week!</p>

And well... it was quite a week. I doxxed myself with around 60 emails hitting my inbox on the first day. Writing this newsletter sometimes feels a bit lonely, but it really reminded me of why I sit down every week. Having all these replies and conversations gave me a nice and fuzzy feeling!</p>
<p>Also, Mark, Michelle, Derek, Zoran, Evan, and Francis provided testimonials for the Web Weekly site, and Michal, Jason, and Jules started to support Web Weekly with a monthly coffee donation! <strong>A special thanks goes to all of you!</strong></p>
<p>So, thank you all for reading along and if you enjoy Web Weekly, share it with your friends and family.</p>

<p>I love this! We can now drop <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements right into the page, use <code>@scope</code>, and the styles will be applied only to the surrounding container. Good stuff.</p>
<p>If you haven't used <code>@scope</code>, here's why you might want to prefer it over naming conventions.</p>

<p>I read about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/using" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FStatements%2Fusing')">the <code>using</code> declaration syntax</a> in early JS proposals, but thanks to Matt, I learned that it actually works in Node.js 24 today. What's <code>using</code>, though?</p>
<p>With a little bit of JS trickery and well-known symbols, objects can be cleaned up when their variables go out of scope. There's no need for <code>try/catch/finally</code> or other dances.</p>
<p>Does it work in browsers, too? We're close. Safari has yet to join the party.</p>

<p>Adam published a post pushing all the new web and CSS features to the limit. Granted, all this <code>select</code> sugar is mainly a Chrome-only thing right now, but this post feels like a reference piece of cutting-edge CSS in 2026.</p>
<p>Put some time on your calendar and explore <code>::picker-icon</code>, <code>::checkmark</code>, <code>&lt;selectedcontent&gt;</code>, <code>@starting-style</code>, and many more new features!</p>
<p>But what about Safari and Firefox? Well, they'll render good old <code>select</code> elements like the ones we've been dealing with for the last 10 years. So no big deal.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2025/" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Falmanac.httparchive.org%2Fen%2F2025%2F')">the yearly Web Almanac</a> didn't include a CSS chapter for a couple of years, because analyzing all that data is a ton of work and things are &quot;a little complicated&quot;.</p>
<p>Bart, who maintains <a href="https://www.projectwallace.com/" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.projectwallace.com%2F')">some popular CSS analyzers</a>, took the matter into his own hands and &quot;just&quot; wrote the tooling to analyze the CSS of 100k popular domains. What an initiative! ❤️</p>
<p>If you're into fun stats like the biggest discovered stylesheet being 52MB, sites with 4,858 <code>@support</code> rules, or the highest found selector specificity being <code>146,1546,159</code>, this post is for you.</p>
<p>Side note: of course, the report also includes useful stats like the one that <code>@container</code> queries were used on 10% of the crawled pages!</p>

<p>If you're working in startup land like I do, you usually have a logo collection showing off how many big brands use your product somewhere on the marketing site. And most of the time, these logo clouds (lanes? soups?) look terrible because all the logos have different ratios, heights, and perceived weights.</p>
<p>Sanity released a React library to tame this problem using &quot;the Proportional Image Normalization Formula&quot;. Use these words if you want to sound smart at parties.</p>
<p>Regardless, I added the component to the WW site and it works great!</p>

<p>Last week I plugged the <a href="https://webweekly.email/archive/web-weekly-182/#a-new-meta-element-is-coming-to-town" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fwebweekly.email%2Farchive%2Fweb-weekly-182%2F%23a-new-meta-element-is-coming-to-town')">new <code>text-scale</code> element</a>, which enables Chrome to also bump up the font size if folks have increased font size settings in their OS.</p>
<p>So far so good. Adrian had a deeper look at how this behavior could work across all browser engines. And things are complicated. Or as he puts it, a bit Frankenstyle.</p>

<p>Speaking of semantic markup, if you use elements like <code>header</code> or <code>footer</code>, they get some specific ARIA roles applied. It's <code>banner</code> for <code>header</code> elements and <code>contentinfo</code> for <code>footer</code> elements.</p>
<p>But do you know that these elements can change their role depending on where they're placed in the DOM? There's been a rather recent change to the ARIA spec, and browsers have started to ship it!</p>

<p>If you're slightly worried about <code>npm</code> and <code>npmjs<wbr>.com</code>, you're not alone. Especially since the website doesn't seem to have received updates in ages. <code>npmx</code> is a modern alternative built by the community. The site looks very slick, and especially the file explorer is such an improvement!</p>
<p>It stands out that the project isn't much older than a month and has already gathered 178 contributors. Is this one of the rare examples showing that open source and community-led efforts work? I hope so!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h3>Patch Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix VirtualUrlPlugin Windows compatibility by sanitizing cache keys and filenames. Cache keys now use <code>toSafePath</code> to replace colons (<code>:</code>) with double underscores (<code>__</code>) and sanitize other invalid characters, ensuring compatibility with Windows filesystem restrictions.

</li>
<li>
<p>Revert part of the createRequire generation behavior for <code>require("node:...")</code> to keep compatibility with those modules exports, e.g. <code>const EventEmitter = require("node:events");</code>. (by <a href="https://github.com/hai-x">@hai-x</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20433" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20433/hovercard">#20433</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skip guard collection when exports-presence mode is disabled to improve parsing performance.

            <description><![CDATA[<h3>Minor Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allow resolving worker module by export condition name when using <code>new Worker()</code> (by <a href="https://github.com/hai-x">@hai-x</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20353" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20353/hovercard">#20353</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detect conditional imports to avoid compile-time linking errors for non-existent exports. (by <a href="https://github.com/hai-x">@hai-x</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20320" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20320/hovercard">#20320</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added the <code>tsconfig</code> option for the <code>resolver</code> options (replacement for <code>tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin</code>). Can be <code>false</code> (disabled), <code>true</code> (use the default <code>tsconfig.json</code> file to search for it), a string path to <code>tsconfig.json</code>, or an object with <code>configFile</code> and <code>references</code> options. (by <a href="https://github.com/alexander-akait">@alexander-akait</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20400" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20400/hovercard">#20400</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support <code>import.defer()</code> for context modules. (by <a href="https://github.com/ahabhgk">@ahabhgk</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20399" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20399/hovercard">#20399</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for array values ​​to the <code>devtool</code> option. (by <a href="https://github.com/hai-x">@hai-x</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20191" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20191/hovercard">#20191</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve rendering node built-in modules for ECMA module output. (by <a href="https://github.com/hai-x">@hai-x</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20255" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20255/hovercard">#20255</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unknown import.meta properties are now determined at runtime instead of being statically analyzed at compile time. (by <a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiaojx">@xiaoxiaojx</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20312" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20312/hovercard">#20312</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Patch Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed ESM default export handling for <code>.mjs</code> files in Module Federation (by <a href="https://github.com/y-okt">@y-okt</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20189" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20189/hovercard">#20189</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimized <code>import.meta.env</code> handling in destructuring assignments by using cached stringified environment definitions. (by <a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiaojx">@xiaoxiaojx</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20313" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20313/hovercard">#20313</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect the <code>stats.errorStack</code> option in stats output. (by <a href="https://github.com/samarthsinh2660">@samarthsinh2660</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20258" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20258/hovercard">#20258</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug where declaring a <code>module</code> variable in module scope would conflict with the default <code>moduleArgument</code>. (by <a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiaojx">@xiaoxiaojx</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20265" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20265/hovercard">#20265</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix VirtualUrlPlugin to set resourceData.context for proper module resolution. Previously, when context was not set, it would fallback to the virtual scheme path (e.g., <code>virtual:routes</code>), which is not a valid filesystem path, causing subsequent resolve operations to fail. (by <a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiaojx">@xiaoxiaojx</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20390" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20390/hovercard">#20390</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed Worker self-import handling to support various URL patterns (e.g., <code>import.meta.url</code>, <code>new URL(import.meta.url)</code>, <code>new URL(import.meta.url, import.meta.url)</code>, <code>new URL("./index.js", import.meta.url)</code>). Workers that resolve to the same module are now properly deduplicated, regardless of the URL syntax used.

</li>
<li>
<p>Reuse the same async entrypoint for the same Worker URL within a module to avoid circular dependency warnings when multiple Workers reference the same resource.

</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize source map generation: only include <code>ignoreList</code> property when it has content, avoiding empty arrays in source maps. (by <a href="https://github.com/xiaoxiaojx">@xiaoxiaojx</a> in <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/20319" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/webpack/webpack/pull/20319/hovercard">#20319</a>)</p>

<p>A quick &quot;repost&quot; really helps this indie newsletter out. Thank you! ❤️</p>

      <h2 id="web-weekly-housekeeping">Web Weekly housekeeping</h2></div><p>Web Weekly's open rate is at 48% these days. Marketers would be jealous, but not too long ago it was in the mid-fifties. I'm not really concerned about it (yet), but <a href="https://cassidoo.co/post/do-not-scale-2/" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcassidoo.co%2Fpost%2Fdo-not-scale-2%2F')">Cassidy shared that her newsletter stats improved</a> simply by asking people to reply to her emails. Even though I risk destroying my inbox with this ask, <strong>if you enjoy my tiny newsletter, could you reply to it</strong>? I'd really like to see if more replies will help Web Weekly get into the primary inbox.</p>
<p>Secondly, David reported that Web Weekly doesn't work well in the Spark email client. I'm considering going full-blown custom HTML for a while. Are there more issues? Do you have any troubles reading the email in your client? If so, you guessed it, hit reply and let me know!</p>
<p>And lastly, writing Web Weekly takes a lot of time. And with the AI-volution being in full swing, I sometimes wonder if there's a future for blogging, curating, and indie publishing. If you enjoy Web Weekly, <strong>earn yourself a huge bag of karma points</strong> and join 33 supporters on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/stefanjudis" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2Fstefanjudis')">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/stefanjudis/" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsponsors%2Fstefanjudis%2F')">GitHub Sponsors</a>.

<p>Our friends over at CodePen released 2025's most popular pens, and, of course, the collection is full of eye candy. I'm always amazed by the quality people put into &quot;fiddling on CodePen&quot; but without surprise, my favorites were the ones coming without three.js or GSAP.</p>

<p>I usually list interesting GitHub projects at the end, but this JavaScript util is such a banger that it deserves its own spot! You know that when you use <code>Promise<wbr>.all</code> you can wait for promises to resolve in parallel. However, things become interesting when the promises depend on each other.</p>
<p>Usually, you'd then need to untangle everything to get the optimal loading order. <a href="https://github.com/shuding/better-all" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fbetter-all')"><code>better-all</code> does this for you</a>! I love it!</p>

<p>View transitions make it very easy to morph elements into a new state, but I still struggled creating custom enter/exit animations. Cyd shared how you can use <code>:only-child</code> for this. TIL!</p>

The <code>command</code> and <code>commandfor</code> attributes let you define interactivity with declarative HTML.</p>
<p>But what about custom functionality? Pawel shares an often overlooked feature, explaining that you can define custom commands with a double-dash (<code>--do-something</code>). Good stuff!</p>

<p>Now, if you ever wondered whether fancy text effects paired with countless <code>span</code> elements, <code>aria-hidden</code>, and <code>aria-label</code> have an impact on UX or A11y, this post might become a future reference piece!</p>

<p>Quick'n'dirty; do you know that you can place form elements outside of the actual <code>form</code>? <a href="https://html-css-tip-of-the-week.netlify.app/tip/fieldset-and-legend/" style="--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fhtml-css-tip-of-the-week.netlify.app%2Ftip%2Ffieldset-and-legend%2F')">Kevin describes how to do it with a <code>fieldset</code></a>. But it works with <code>input</code> and <code>button</code> elements via the <code>form</code> attribute, too.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The classes are so new that there aren't MDN pages yet, but I'm super excited about this tiny search improvement.</p>
<p>I'm pretty quick with hitting <code>CMD + F</code> because often I can't be bothered with using the provided site search (if there is one). However, sometimes it's hard to understand what's currently selected if you're looking at multiple matching substrings.</p>
<p>Today I learned, this is a Chrome/Firefox problem because Safari's &quot;find in page&quot; feature adds an overlay while highlighting the current substring.</p>

<p>This looks great, but I won't switch browsers for a better in-page search experience. So what about Chrome and Firefox?</p>
<p><code>::search-text</code> allows you to style the found strings to follow your site's style. This is good stuff but not really helping with understanding the currently selected search string. This is where <code>::search-text:current</code> comes into play. Check this out!</p>
<p>[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]</p>
<p>If you're on Chrome 144 right now, search the page for &quot;doggo&quot;! The matching strings in the component above are matching my site's colors and you can now see which dog is the selected search entry. It doesn't look as fancy as the Safari overlay but I'll buy it!</p>
